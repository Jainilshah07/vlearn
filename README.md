**"You Never Fail Until You Stop Trying! ".**
**This project bagged 1st place in a 24-hour Hackathon - 'Bit-n-Build 2023' held by GDSC Fr.crce x UMIT and is based on AI/ML and integrated into Web Interface.
Built with innovation and dedication by The Machine Minds - Jainil Shah, Saloni Shah, Aakash Goradia, and Krishang Shah.**

Welcome to VLearn, the ultimate learning platform, helps the teacher to identify which students need extra attention in a particular subject by fetching those particular students' ids on the Teacher's Dashboard using Machine Learning Algorithm.
Students can view their performance summary through the dashboard in the form of graphs that we have visualized on basis of every subject's Term Test marks.
Students can also calculate the Risk Factor by entering their term test marks to get a predicted SGPA and get proper attention if they fall in the risk zone.
